# Code Refactoring

## Overview

In this code refactoring, I aimed to reorganize the code into three distinct layers: Application, Service, and Repository.

## Application Layer:

- **Responsibility:** The application layer serves as the top layer and is responsible for interacting with end-users or external systems. It handles user interfaces, user input, and presents information to users.
  
- **Components:**
  - **Controllers:** Handle user input and interaction. They receive requests from the user interface, process them, and interact with the service layer to retrieve or update data.
  - **Views:** Responsible for presenting data to users. They receive information from controllers and display it in a user-friendly format.

## Service Layer:

- **Responsibility:** The service layer contains the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the application layer and the data access layer (repository). It encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the application.
  
- **Components:**
  - **Services:** Classes or components that implement business logic. They orchestrate operations, perform validation, and coordinate the flow of data between the application layer and the repository.
  - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Used to transfer data between the application layer and the service layer in a structured and efficient manner.
  - **Business Logic:** Rules or operations specific to the application's domain are implemented in the service layer.

## Repository Layer:

- **Responsibility:** The repository layer is responsible for handling data access and storage. It abstracts away the details of how data is stored (e.g., in a database) from the service layer.
  
- **Components:**
  - **Repositories:** Responsible for querying and persisting data. They abstract the details of data storage and retrieval, providing a clean interface for the service layer to interact with the underlying data store.
  - **Entities:** Represent the data model and are typically mapped to database tables. Entities are used to model and manipulate data within the application.

## Communication Between Layers:

- The application layer communicates with the service layer when business operations need to be performed.
- The service layer interacts with the repository layer to retrieve or persist data.
- The repository layer handles the actual storage and retrieval of data.

## Additional Changes:

In addition to the layer structure, I introduced a new service layer to allow for more specific services in controllers, minimizing the need for creating many controllers. This approach facilitates injecting various services (e.g., MembershipService, RegistrationService) into UserController.
I also implemented core functions like Request, Response, and Render data result for reusability. Additionally, I integrated Redis to improve query performance on data retrieval. To enhance error handling, I introduced try-catch blocks in the business logic of the service layer, making it easier to capture and handle exceptions.
